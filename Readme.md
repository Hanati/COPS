### COPS: detecting co-occurrence and spatial arrangement of transcription factor binding motifs in genome-wide datasets.(2012; PMID:23272209)
---

COPS (Co-Occurrence Pattern Search), a bioinformatics tool based on a combination of association rules and Markov chain models, which detects co-occurring TF binding sites (BSs) on genomic regions of interest. COPS scans DNA sequences for frequent motif patterns using a Frequent-Pattern tree based data mining approach.

list of thing need to be updated
1. add the run main function
2. how to run
